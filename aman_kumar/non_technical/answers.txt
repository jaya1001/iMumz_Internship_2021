1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) I am active on Twitter, so there i follow a lot of GDEs and open source contributors of flutter (Pawan Kumar, Ayush Shekhar, Tadas Petra, Himanshu Sharma, Andrea Bizzotto to name a few)
B) I actively participate and host rooms on flutter at clubhouse so there also i get to learn a lot about flutter.

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A) My favourite IDE is VS Code
and these are my 5 most used keyboard shortcuts
1. shift+delete : to delete a line
2. select text and alt+shift+arrow_up or arrow_down: to copy a paragraph up or down.
3. win+v to check my cliboard history
4. alt+arrow_up/arrow_down to move a line up or down
5. i use extensions for code genration for flutter_bloc and flutter

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A)
Instead of hardcoding a value everywhere usually I use, `MediaQuery.of(context).size` to get size of screen and then i multiply it with some factor to get size close to design.

I have also used packages like `flutter_screenutil` where I provide the dimensions of figma mockups and then use their functions to calculate size by providing values from design.
